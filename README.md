Hotel Management System

The Hotel Management System is a database project built with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 2022. It’s made to make hotel operations easier, faster, and more organized. Instead of keeping records in different places, this system keeps everything - from guest details to payments -all in one place.

The main idea is to help hotels manage their daily tasks smoothly, like booking rooms, checking guests in and out, keeping track of payments, and managing staff information. Everything runs through one connected system, so it’s simple to find data and make updates whenever needed.

Features


Guest Management

This part stores all the information about guests -like their name, address, and contact details. It helps the hotel give better, more personalized service and easily find guest records when needed.

Room Management

Rooms are managed by their ID, number, type, and status. This makes it easy to see which rooms are available, occupied, or under maintenance at any time.

Reservation Management

Handles all bookings - linking guests to specific rooms with check-in and check-out dates. It helps the hotel avoid double bookings and keeps reservation details up to date.

Staff Management

Stores staff details like name, position, salary and other necessary information. It helps the hotel organize shifts, track performance, and manage employee data efficiently.

Payment Management

Keeps track of all payments connected to reservations. This ensures bills are accurate, payments are recorded properly, and financial reports are always up to date.

Service Management

Covers extra services like spa, dining, or laundry. These services are linked to guests and payments, so everything is included in one complete billing system.

Technology Used

The system is built with Microsoft SQL Server, which provides strong data security, high performance, and easy access to information. It supports features like stored procedures, triggers, and transactions which keep everything consistent and reliable.

It can also be connected later to a front desk app or a website for a more complete hotel management experience.

Why This System Matters

Running a hotel involves managing a lot of information -guests, rooms, staff, bookings, and payments. Doing all that manually can lead to mistakes and wasted time. With this system, everything becomes simpler:

· Data is organized and easy to search

· Bookings and payments are accurate

· Staff and guests can be managed in one place

· Reports can be generated anytime

Conclusion

In short, the Hotel Management System is designed to make hotel life easier -for both the staff and the guests. It keeps operations running smoothly, saves time, reduces errors, and helps hotels provide better service overall.
